# Two Sum II - Input array is sorted

This is a solution for the [Two Sum II - Input array is sorted problem] on LeetCode.

## Problem Description

Given an array of integers that is already **sorted in ascending order**, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

The function should return the indices of the two numbers as an array where the first index is 1 and the second index is 2.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution and you may not use the same element twice.

## Example

Input:
```python
numbers = [2, 7, 11, 15]
target = 9
